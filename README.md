# Тук-тук
"Тук-тук" is a service where people renting an apartment can find a roommate, or find a friend to search for an apartment together.

## Target Audience
Our target audience is students. We want to create a very convenient solution for them, so it would be a lot easier to find roommates.

## Main Functionality
- Every user has their own profile.  
- There will be a page with roommate search ads. User can upload own photos of an apartment or leave a third-party link.
- There will be a page with users' posts about themselves so people can group with them for an apartment search.
