# Тук тук
"Тук-тук" is a service where people already renting an apartment can find a roommates who share common interests to share rent, or find a group of people to search for a desired apartment together.

## Target Audience
Our target audience is students but anyone can use the service. We want to create a very convenient solution for everyone, so it would be a lot easier to find roommates.

## Main Functionality
- User can register. Every user has their own profile filled with detailed information about himself (including name, working schedule, age, sex, desired district, personal qualities, preferences about roommates, price range, life goals etc.).
- User can make posts. There are two kinds of posts:
  - group gathering with intention to find and share a flat later on;
  - searching for a roommate to join existing group which rents a particular flat.
- Communication via external links to Telegram, Viber etc. 
- Embedded chat may be added later on.

## Technologies
### Front-end:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

### Back-end:
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL

More can be added soon.
