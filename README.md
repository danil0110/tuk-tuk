# Тук тук
"Тук-тук" is a service where people already renting an apartment can find a roommates who share common interests to share rent, or find a group of people to search for a desired apartment together.

## Target Audience
Our target audience is students but anyone can use the service. We want to create a very convenient solution for everyone, so it would be a lot easier to find roommates.

## User Stories
- User can register, login, have access to his profile and edit it (including name, working schedule, age, sex, desired district, personal qualities, preferences about roommates, price range, life goals etc.).
- User can make posts. There are two kinds of posts:
  - group gathering with intention to find and share a flat later on (info about himself, desired location etc.);
  - searching for a roommate to join existing group which rents a particular flat (user can add own photos of flat or add a third-party link to original ad);
- User can communicate with other user (Telegram, Viber etc. or embedded chat).

## Technologies
### Front-end:
- HTML

- JS

### Back-end:

More can be added soon.
